Urban scaling analysis has shown that various aggregated urban quantities obey power-law relationships with the population size.
Through the classification of Indonesian cities based on the microstructure of their GDP in terms of heterogeneity and spatial dispersion, and by analyzing the scaling exponents within each classification, we uncover a non-trivial relationship between scaling behavior and the GDP microstructure.

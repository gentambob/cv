    Kos2an <b>without</b> any rule related to the disallowance of premarital cohabitation.

    Such rule includes gendered property, explicit bans of visit/stay of "opposite sex" and spesific exception for the "married couple".

Kos-Kosan, also known as "*inde kost*" or "*kost*," is a term used in Indonesia to refer to boarding houses or rented rooms. Kos-Kosan provides affordable accommodation for individuals who are studying or working away from their hometowns. These establishments are typically located in urban areas near universities, schools, or business districts to meet the demands of students, young professionals, and migrant workers who require convenient and affordable housing options.

[//]: <> (Kos-Kosan facilities often consist of single or shared rooms with basic amenities such as a bed, desk, chair, wardrobe, and sometimes an attached bathroom. Common areas like kitchens, dining spaces, and communal living rooms may be available for tenants to share. Kos-Kosan may also provide additional facilities such as Wi-Fi, laundry services, parking spaces, and 24-hour security.)

The owners tend to impose in-house rules, and such rules may include the disallowance of cohabitation for unmarried couples. Premarital cohabitation, known as "*kumpul kebo*" in Indonesia, is considered a transgression of cultural, religious, and legal norms. These norms emphasize the sanctity of marriage (or virginity) and promote traditional family values. Landlords may enforce this rule to maintain a certain reputation and cater to the majority of the target market that adheres to these values.


This project aims to investigate if there is socio-spatial variation in how this moral value translates into rules in kos-kosan.
To answer this, I scraped a <a href='https://mamikos.com'>website</a> that provides information on kost2an and mapped their *numbers* based on the imposition of rules related to premarital cohabitation.
